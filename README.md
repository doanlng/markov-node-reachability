The following is a project written as a final deliverable for CS3314.  This uses java annotations to create a logical prolog structure which instead encapsulates probablistic logic instead of binary logic.  The prolog file is read by a cpp file and the output is stored in a java object. 

The content of which is a reachability measure in which java annotations determine the probabilities of moving from one state to another and the result is how reachable reaching a certain node is.
